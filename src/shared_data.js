  aboutParaOne: "During the five years of my work-study Software Master Architect, I was able to develop my technical skills through two methods that in my opinion must coexist and be inseparable from each other. First of all theoretical teaching, in particular through very high-quality project-based pedagogy, then of course practical experience, gained directly in the professional world, which moreover worked on the new teaching.",
  aboutParaTwo: "For so long that I can't put a date or period on it, I have always been passionate about computer programming. It stimulates just as much my logical and pragmatic side, but also my imagination in the creation of solutions, without omitting perhaps the most important thing in my eyes: programming is a great opportunity to challenge myself, to set myself ever more daring goals for get closer and closer to the purest optimization of my work.",
  aboutParaThree: "Through my travel and the creation of silver jewelry, the design of clothes and the online sale of these, I have also seen a real attraction for manual and artistic activities, and I don't think I have to be ashamed now of my skills in these areas as well.",
